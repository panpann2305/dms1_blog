## Idea

My video portrays my personality and identity through the film photos I have taken—capturing moments that define who I am. Film photography is one of my passions, and each photo represents a different aspect of what matters to me and shapes me as a person. From family and friends to my favorite toys, wandering through supermarkets, and my love for photography, these images piece together a visual narrative of my life and the things that make me, me. Through this video, I aim to create an experience that feels like being inside a camera lens, seeing the world through my eyes and witnessing the things that have shaped me.

## Process

I use both old and new footage in my video, filming new material based on the old film photos that represent what makes me who I am. I capture moments from everyday life—going to the supermarket, wandering around, and having fun with friends. I also incorporate camera shutter sounds and a transition effect to white throughout the video to create the feeling of being inside the lens of a real film camera.
