# Classroom Activities
- I was surprised on how music effects our feelings, the video we watched in class (the changes of music in a Lion King's scene) make me realised that.
- I gain many useful sound editing technique that can be applied in my videos.

### Idea

My video portrays my personality and identity through the film photos I have takenâ€”capturing moments that define who I am. Film photography is one of my passions, and each photo represents a different aspect of what matters to me and shapes me as a person. From family and friends to my favorite toys, wandering through supermarkets, and my love for photography, these images piece together a visual narrative of my life and the things that make me, me. Through this video, I aim to create an experience that feels like being inside a camera lens, seeing the world through my eyes and witnessing the things that have shaped me. You can see me smiling through all of the scenes except for the studying scene. That's actually how I felt when I started learning Digital Media. It's fun, and I'm in love with it, but there's still a little bit of fear, a bit of overwhelm. But at the end of the day, I really enjoy it!

### Process

I use both old and new footage in my video, filming new material based on the old film photos that represent what makes me who I am. I capture moments from everyday lifeâ€”going to the supermarket, wandering around, and having fun with friends. I also incorporate camera shutter sounds and a transition effect to white throughout the video to create the feeling of being inside the lens of a real film camera.
