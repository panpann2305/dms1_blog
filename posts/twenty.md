The third part is each of my asssignment island. The island have my assignment work, presented in different ways, I added some objects that are related to the assignment. Also, I build up mountains, rocks, cloud to make it become an actual island. I choose blue for background color because it can be represented as sky and also ocean, so it matches with the islands.
