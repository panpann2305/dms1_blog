# Who am I

![me](introduction/IMG_8986.jpg)

Hello everyone, I'm An aka Pan, an Vietnamese girl now studying Digital Media at RMIT Melbourne. My MBTI type is ENFP-T, so you can see that I’m always full of energy, both in real life and in my design works. I discovered my passion for design in high school, and now I’m on a journey to explore and experience the vast world of design. I hope that those experiences, whether big or small, successful or unsuccessful, are still wonderful things in my life.

My life motto is: Trust yourself, everything will be allright!

# What am I made of

- Cute things (trinkets, plushies, toys,...)
- Sweet treats

- Design, design, design

- Love from my lovers
