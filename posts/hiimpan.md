# ✿ Who am I?

![me](introduction/IMG_8986.jpg)

Hello everyone, I'm An, also known as Pan, a Vietnamese girl currently studying Digital Media at RMIT Melbourne. As an ENFP-T, I'm always bursting with energy—both in real life and in my design work. I discovered my passion for design in high school, and now I'm on a journey to explore and immerse myself in the vast world of design. No matter how big or small, successful or unsuccessful, I believe that every experience along the way is a wonderful part of my life.

My life motto is: **Trust the universe - trust yourself, you know more than you think you do ✮**

# ✿ What am I made of?

- Design, design, design

- Love from my loved ones
