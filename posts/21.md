# ✿ Classroom Activities

I tested the contrast between the text's main color and the background, and it passed!

I also tried to apply the 12 column grid on Amazone (mobile layout) and it fits (the search bar, the function icons, the panel)

With the laptop layout, I think Apple did a well job (the properties bar, images, search bar)


# ✿ Homework Tasks

After hearing Thomas comments about my work, I decided to expand my workspace and make it both direction scroll to increase the curiousity when scrolling.

I was concerning about how to build the layout of the designer bio part at the previous blog post, and I figure it out!

I added an opening "mind - map" - talking about myself but with a simple word which helps users to understand but not TRULY understand about me, to make them feel curious and want to explore my web page more. And I think it is a good intention to the webpage with something that represent me.

From the original webframe version, I change the side bar from left to top for the mobile layout, also increase/decrease the size of elements to make the web be friendly in using. Luckily, I can implemented all I wanted and those all work well!
