# Classroom Activities
It is really interesting to learn about sounds (it's kinda my first time). This is my first time heard words such as: materialisation, synchresis, misattribution, diagetic / nondiegetic, reactive attention, volitional attention, etc. I realized that the small details I saw in videos actually has it's importance and can strongly impact the audience.

# Homework Tasks

## Important things about my video

### Key moment: It is the opening, of course!

#### Combination of visual and sound

- I create a scene when I meet my friend and ask her: "Do you know what is inside of my heart". She will answer: "No". Then I will think about the way to give her an answer and an idea pop up in my head (silence conversation)
- I will include the "loading screen" sound in the moment that I was thinking about the answer, after that when I have an idea, there will be a finger snap sound.

**Overall emotion:** Happiness (just a conversation with your friend)
- My editing includes both diegetic and non-diegetic sound so it will be a litte bit funny and silly

**Relationship between shots**
- A process of asking, thinking, answering

**Rhythm, tempo, or pace**
- Keeping the real tempo of the conversation
