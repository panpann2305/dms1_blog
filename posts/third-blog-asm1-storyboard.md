My idea for the asm1 video is to create a short story about what makes me, ME! It will describe my hobbys, what i usually do, what is important to me, etc.

# Continuity
I will maintain the continuity in my video through
1. Ordinal numbers
2. Scenes
example: the camera flash is on and then the taken photos will appear in the next scene)
3. Prop repetition
...

# Editing
I hope to bring joy and hapiness for viewers through my self portrait video since I'm a ENFP girl that have a lot of fun in her life. The background music will be soft but joyful in stead of sad. I will mostly use cut and fade technique because there are many different scenes that are not actually linked, however, that kind of editing can make the viewers concentrate because the speed is not too slow or fast. Also, fast cut and fade can actually drawn pop up memories, just reminds you of what makes you, YOU!
