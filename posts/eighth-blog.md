## How I apply elements of design

- I use mostly organic shape in my design because when it comes to "dream", we usually think of something magical, hopeful, imaginative, promissing.
- The color palette I choose consists of blue and yellow with different shades, combining complementary and monochromatic color schemes.
- I use smooth and hand - drawn lines.
