It’s a process of deciding and refining to give my icons the best quality—visually, in terms of color, and in meaning.

Blue and yellow were my first choices, but after receiving some advice, I added purple to create more contrast—and fortunately, it turned out really well.

At the beginning, it was quite challenging to figure out how to convey complex meanings through simple icons. But day by day, things became clearer. I’m really thankful for Thomas and my colleagues—their feedback truly helped me improve this assignment!
