Today was our playtesting session and I was super impressed with everyone’s worlds — they looked amazing and were so detailed! I also got some really helpful feedback on my 3D environment, so thank you so much, guys!

# ✿ LAST DESCRIPTION OF "FROM DESK TO DREAM"

I created an overall view at the starting point and changed the positions and details of the roads.

**Road 1** uses a soft foam texture, just like in the reference. It’s a straight road with no slope, symbolizing a peaceful and smooth journey from kindergarten to primary and secondary school. This road has fences on both sides, showing safety and guidance in early life.

**Road 2** is made of stone, with green grass on both sides. It represents the fresh and lively feeling of youth when moving from secondary to high school. This road also has fences, but it has a slight slope — showing the first important challenges of growing up, though there's still support along the way.

**The last road**, from high school to university, is the steepest one. After turning 18, we start facing more and more difficulties. The road becomes steeper, higher, and full of rocks. There are no fences, showing how unsteady and risky this stage can be — it's easy to fall or feel lost. But once you go through it, you reach the dream room, where you can finally achieve your dreams.

At first, I created a **"collect the stars" activity** at the end of the journey to say “follow your dreams,” using text to explain it. But now, I changed it into a star path with a signboard without any words, so players can figure it out by themselves.

After fixing and adding details, I feel really happy with how it turned out!
