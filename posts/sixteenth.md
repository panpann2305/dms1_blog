I noticed that some of the objects are not well-proportioned, and the path isn't very user-friendly because it's easy to fall off. I plan to add fences and adjust the object scales to improve the overall balance. The lighting also feels a bit inconsistent, so I’ll make some changes to improve that as well.

- The testers were my friends in Viet Nam
- They understand the concept
- They can easily move around but it was easy to fall down because the paths have no fences
-> I fixed that
- I added some more objects and fixed the object's ratio as well as the sound volume
