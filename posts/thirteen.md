**This is my world!!!!**

I brainstormed ideas for each environment and started placing cubes, spheres, and cylinders in them. It actually turned out pretty well! The kindergarten and high school phases are outdoor spaces, while the other two (secondary and university) are indoors. There are paths connecting each space (I haven't created them yet), and along the sides of these paths are the challenges encountered when progressing through each phase.
