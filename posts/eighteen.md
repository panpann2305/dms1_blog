# ✿ Homework Tasks
## Answering questions
### Assignment 1 - Video Edit 
**• How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?**
I used sound to match the mood of each scene. Happy visuals had cheerful music, and calm moments had softer sounds. I also timed some cuts with the music to make everything feel smooth and connected.

**• How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?**
I choose the footage that relates to the elements I want to express about myself. Some is old footage, and some is new.

**• What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?**
I learn that sound can change our emotions easily, so I carefully choose the sound that is related to the emotion and does not make viewers misunderstand the feeling I want to describe.

**• How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?**
I want to create a chill vibe video, so I didn't use that much pacing. But at some point I want to make it faster to create attraction, so I use fast pacing and a stronger rhythm.

**• Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?**
I choose my interest in toys and design, film camera, my memories, and relationship from the past, and also the creative, cute, energetic part of me.

**• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?**
Nostalgia, I think.


### Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons
**• How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?**
I choose Dream because it is a comfortable concept for me. It fits my personality so it is easier for me to be imaginative and creative. I summarise my idea by putting it in a context - an app about every aspect of dreams.

**• Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?**
Yes, I have 5 sketches for each icon. I change the elements, the shape arrangement. I end up with my chosen icon because it is the most recognizable for the meaning I want to describe

**• How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?**
I follow the hand-drawn path and create the shape in Illustrator. I think nothing was lost, and I gained more perfect shapes.

**• How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?**
I first chose to use blue and yellow, because its kind of related to dream (both happy and sad). Then i have a homework tasks of testing different color combination. Then i created some more combination, and the blue yellow purple one is one of that. My friend said that color combination is the most attractive so i end up with this color.

**• How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?**
The sounds are all dreamy and remind everyone of a dream. They also describe the meaning of the icon function.

**• How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?**
I think about the meaning and the actually action that user will do after they press the icon.

### Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment
**• How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?**
The prototype gives me an overview of the environment and helps me to organize, imagine, and create more details of the world. 

**• How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?**
I have to care more about the dimension and ratio. Everything needs to be in a good scale, neither too big nor too small, and have to fit well with each other. I also have to be concerned about the errors that can occur, for example, I have to build fences on roads so players can't fall off

**• What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?**
Create the player's view of the environment.

**• How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?**
I choose the sound based on the elements I want to describe (like the ABC song, airplane sound, school bell sound). It’s similar to assignment 2

**• How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?**
I use bright colors and familiar shapes to fit with the theme, and also recognizable sounds. I actually don’t change the theme from the start to the end, so it didn’t evolve that much, I think.

**• What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?**
I discovered some bugs that happen, and also the overview of the environment in a player’s view.

## First artist statement draft
### What makes me, ME
I created a video about what makes me me. I'm made of my passion for photography, my love for toys, and the care I've received from my family and friends. And above all, I’m surrounded by joy!

Through this project, I realized that I have a strong sense of personal identity. That makes it easy for me to recognize what I love and what I want. So when creating this video, coming up with content wasn’t difficult—the real challenge was in the technical side: cutting scenes to match the emotions, and choosing the right sound to support the mood.

One of my biggest motivations was to record the memories I’ve had throughout my life—moments that shaped me, made me happy, and stayed with me.

In the end, I just wanted people to understand more about who I am, and what I truly value.

### Dreamy Dream
I used Illustrator to design a set of icons around the theme of dreams—specifically, icons for an app where users can explore and record their personal experiences related to different aspects of dreaming.

I’ve always considered myself a dreamer—someone who loves colors, new experiences, and the feeling of wandering through the unknown. Dreams are abstract and undefined; they don’t have a fixed shape or color, and they can be anything. That’s why I felt a strong connection to this theme.

I used a split-complementary color palette with three main colors: blue, yellow, and purple—with deep blue and deep purple as accent colors. I also worked with organic shapes to give myself the freedom to experiment and let my imagination flow.

Alongside the visuals, I added sounds that evoke a dreamy, mystical feeling—yet still give users subtle hints about the function of each icon, since these icons are designed for a real app.

When people look at and interact with these icons, I hope they feel intrigued and visually delighted by the playful shapes and vibrant colors.

### From Desk to Dream
I created a world in Unity based on the milestones of my own growth—kindergarten, middle school, high school, and university. When I entered university, I realized that everything I know and experience now is the result of what I’ve been building up over the past 16 years of school. That’s why I decided to create a world I’ve actually lived in.

In this world, I’ve faced challenges and difficulties, but I’ve also had so much joy. Above all, I’ve always received love—from the people around me and from the beautiful world itself.

I mainly used materials that reflect the real-life textures of objects, and when you look at the world as a whole, you’ll notice bright colors and a bit of a cute, warm aesthetic—just like my personality. I also used familiar, realistic sounds to enhance the sense of authenticity and make the experience feel even more immersive.

I hope that when people look at the world I’ve made, it brings back memories of their own school days. I hope it makes them feel at ease, joyful, and wrapped in the kind of happiness we used to feel as little kids or students in middle and high school.
