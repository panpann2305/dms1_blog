This is my first time to use Figma and I can't wait to create a website with it!

# ✿ Homework Tasks

My idea is to create a website that users can enjoy a role - play mini game as well as go through my assignments (semester 1 journey). Users will choose a role then go on a route that I planned for each role, then at the end they will receive a small gift and a message.
